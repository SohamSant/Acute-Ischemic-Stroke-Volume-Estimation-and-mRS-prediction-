# Acute Ischemic Stroke Lesions Volume Estimation and mRS Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for analyzing MRI brain images to estimate the volume of acute ischemic stroke lesions and predict the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), a measure of stroke severity and functional outcomes.

**Note:**  
The code in this repository will not work without the `model.h5` files required for lesion segmentation and mRS prediction. If you require these files, please email me at **[sohamsant9@gmail.com](mailto:sohamsant9@gmail.com)**.
